# Assignment 1
- Take a number as input from keyboard.
- store it in a variable 'n'.
- define a function 'factorial()' using 'def' keyword.
- inside the function use a if...else control statement.
- if n <= 2 then function will return n.
- if n >= 2 then there will recursion concept will implement and the function will call repeatedly with argument 'n-1' which will update value of 'n' by reducing value of 'n' by 1 each time function is called

- every returned value of function is multiplied with updated value of n and at value of n = 2 recursion will get stop.
- at last the resultant value is returned and store in a variable 'res'
- res will get printed using print() fuction.


# Assignment 2
- import math module and its pre-defined functions using 'import' and 'from' keyword
- take a number as input from keyword and store it in a variavle 'n'.
- calculate the square root of the number using sqrt() function by passing n as argument.
- calculate the logarithm of the number with base e using log() function by passing n and e as argument.
- calculate sine of the number using sin() function bby passing n as argument.
- then print all the resultant values using print() function.
